[ Event Registration Software ]

<Summary>

This is a software solution developed to streamline the registration and check-in process for job fairs and other events hosted by Career Services at Eastern Washington University. This software was developed by a team of four including myself and has since been developed further for the university by another team.

<How It Works>

The software has three main components: a registration kiosk, pre-registration form, and the database.

The Registration Kiosk is the primary front-end component of the three. The software is loaded onto station computers at the event for use by attendees. It allows users to enter their relevant information for registration, check in, and receive a nametag. The Kiosk interfaces with a Dymo label printer for printing the nametags, as well as a barcode scanner for a quick check-in process for those who pre-registered online.

The pre-registration form functions similar to the Registration Kiosk, however it is hosted online for attendees to register ahead of time for the event. Aside from the basic registration information, the pre-regisration form asks additional survey questions to help improve future events. After registering, these registrants are emailed a barcode on their confirmation of registration (along with a backup code for manual entry) allowing them to check in to the event quickly, without having to enter their information at the Kiosk on-site. 

All of the information provided by registrants is stored in a database online, allowing event coordinators to securely access the information for statistical data. The Registration Kiosk software has a built-in Administrator Tool, password protected to prevent unauthorized usage, that interfaces with the database. The tool allows for registrant look-up and editing, database import and export, adding or removing pre-registration survey questions, configuration of database connection settings, and changing the administrator password.

<Languages and Technologies Used>

For this software, our team utilized C# .NET for the Registration Kiosk and Administrator Tool, MySQL for database querying, and HTML and PHP for the pre-registration form. In addition to the aforementioned Dymo label printer (for nametag printing) and barcode scanner (for quick check-in), we also utilized the Microsoft Office Interop framework for importing and exporting registrant entries to Microsoft Excel files.

< My Job >

I was team lead for this project, overseeing the development process as well as being a part of it. I primarily developed the Registration Kiosk, however I was involved in helping plan, debug, and develop many of the other elements of the software as well. The majority of communication with our client was through me, organizing meetings and ensuring the software was meeting all requirements and expectations.

[ Super Cookie Blaster ]

This is a game I developed, modeled after the classic arcade game Asteroids. The player maneuvers a small rocket ship through space, using various weapons to destroy large cookies that threaten to destroy the ship.

The game was programmed in C# .NET using the XNA libraries. I made the graphics, a few of the sounds, and did all the programming myself.

[ Video Game Trivia Maze ]

This is a game I worked on with three of my classmates. The player must answer trivia questions about video games as they traverse a multi-floored maze, trying to find the trophy on the top floor.

The game was programmed using C# .NET and was my first exposure to the language. I created the graphics for the game and designed the question database editor interface.

[ Escape From Space Prison ]

This is a game I worked on with two of my classmates. It's a terminal-based game where the player attempts to navigate their way through procedurally-generated floors and hallways in a prison filled with deadly alien inmates.

I came up with the idea for the game and developed most of the major systems for the game (combat, characters, inventory, and items). I used my knowledge of object oriented programming and design patterns to structure the code.
